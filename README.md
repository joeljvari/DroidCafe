DroidCafe
==============================================

The Droid Cafe app demonstrates radio buttons, images used as buttons, the options
menu, and up-button navigation, enhanced to include a Settings activity. This
version addresses the challenge to fix the Up button for tablet-sized screens.

Introduction
------------

This app created from the Basic Activity template lets a user tap image buttons
to launch an activity, and choose a single delivery option from radio-button
choices for a food order. The options menu is populated with choices that display
a toast message showing which choice. The app also uses an implicit intent
so that when the user taps the floating action button, it launches the Maps app.

This app has been enhanced to include the Settings Activity template with a
custom setting (Account: Market) and other settings from the template.
